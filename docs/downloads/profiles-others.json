UsageNotes:The activityTime is primarily of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom is reported to have occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different from the effectiveTime of the same Act. However, even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act.

ActPolicyType, which generalizes: ActPrivacyPolicyType, ActSensitivityPrivacyPolicyType, ActSecurityPolicyType.  In the ActClass Code System:  CNTRCT (contract) Description: An agreement of obligation between two or more parties that is subject to contractual law and enforcement, lwhich generalizes FCNTRCT (financial contract) and COV (coverage).  POLICY (policy) - Description: A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by one party on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed. LEAF CONCEPTS: JURISPOL (jurisdictional policy) Description:A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by a jurisdiction on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed.Examples:A jurisdictional mandate regarding the prescribing and dispensing of a particular medication. A jurisdictional privacy or security regulation dictating the manner in which personal health information is disclosed. A jurisdictional requirement that certain services or health conditions are reported to a monitoring program, e.g., immunizations, methadone treatment, or cancer registries.ORGPOL (organizational policy)Examples:A clinical or research protocols imposed by a payer, a malpractice insurer, or an institution to which a provider must adhere. A mandate imposed by a denominational institution for a provider to provide or withhold certain information from the patient about treatment options.SCOPOL (scope of practice policy)Description:An ethical or clinical obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation imposed or strongly encouraged by organizations that oversee particular clinical domains or provider certification which define the boundaries within which a provider may practice and which may have legal basis or ramifications.Examples:An ethical obligation for a provider to fully inform a patient about all treatment options. An ethical obligation for a provider not to disclose personal health information that meets certain criteria, e.g., where disclosure might result in harm to the patient or another person. The set of health care services which a provider is credentialed or privileged to provide. STDPOL (standard of practice policy) Examples:A payer may require a prescribing provider to adhere to formulary guidelines. An institution may adopt clinical guidelines and protocols and implement these within its electronic health record and decision support systems.  CONS (consent)Description: The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc.  The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act. The \"signatures\" to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of \"performer\", the healthcare provider informing the patient, and \"consenter\", the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public."

For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"specimen unsatisfactory\".   \n\nThe alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.",

For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"specimen unsatisfactory\".   \n\nThe alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.",

For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.
