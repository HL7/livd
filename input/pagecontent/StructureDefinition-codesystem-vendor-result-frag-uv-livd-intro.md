### Description

The *LIVD Vendor Result Code Fragment CodeSystem* is a profile on the CodeSystem resource to include the relevant information from an IVD vendor for the result codes to be used in a LIVD instance to enable the full mapping context without having to connect to a remote terminology service or other source of vendor terminology content.
