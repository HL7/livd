# The elementdefinition-maxValueSet extension is used in the Bundle.language element in the base Bundle resource and it appears only in the snapshot, not in the profile differential.
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/bundle-uv-livd: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[4].binding.extension[0]: The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# The code systems for LIVD device and section type are specific to the LIVD IG and are not anticipated to be moved to THO.
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/livd-device-type: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
